# Guide to Choosing RFID Hardware for Time Management

## Selection Criteria for RFID Readers

When selecting RFID readers for your time management system, consider these key factors:

### 1. Communication Protocol

Your application's `rfid_listener.py` expects readers that expose a REST API that returns JSON. Here are your options:

| Protocol | Pros | Cons | Integration Difficulty |
|----------|------|------|------------------------|
| **REST API** | Easy integration with your code, language-agnostic | May require network configuration | Low (already supported) |
| **SDK/Library** | Often more reliable, better error handling | Language-specific, may require code changes | Medium |
| **Serial/USB** | Direct connection, no network required | Requires physical access to the server, driver issues | High |
| **Wiegand** | Industry standard for access control | Requires special interface hardware | High |

**Recommendation**: Choose network-enabled readers with REST API support or those that can be connected to small network devices (like Raspberry Pi) that can provide a REST API interface.

### 2. RFID Technology

| Technology | Frequency | Range | Best For |
|------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Low Frequency (LF)** | 125-134 kHz | 1-10 cm | Small offices, cost-sensitive deployments |
| **High Frequency (HF)** | 13.56 MHz | 10-50 cm | Medium offices, balance of security and convenience |
| **Ultra-High Frequency (UHF)** | 860-960 MHz | 1-12 m | Large facilities, hands-free scanning |
| **Near Field Communication (NFC)** | 13.56 MHz | < 10 cm | Smartphone integration, multi-purpose cards |

**Recommendation**: HF (13.56 MHz) or NFC is typically the best balance for attendance tracking systems. They provide adequate range without excessive cost and are compatible with multi-purpose ID cards.

### 3. Form Factor

| Form Factor | Mounting | Best For |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Wall Mount** | Fixed to wall near entrances/exits | Most time tracking systems |
| **Desktop** | On desk or counter | Reception areas, security desks |
| **Turnstile/Gate** | Integrated with physical access control | High-security facilities |
| **Portable/Handheld** | Carried by staff | Field operations, mobile workers |

**Recommendation**: Wall-mounted readers at entrances and exits are the standard for time tracking.

## RFID Card/Tag Selection

### Card Types

| Card Type | Standards | Security | Typical Cost |
|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **EM Cards** (LF) | 125 kHz | Low | $0.50-$2 |
| **HID Proximity** (LF) | 125 kHz | Low-Medium | $2-$5 |
| **MIFARE Classic** (HF) | ISO 14443A | Medium | $1-$3 |
| **MIFARE DESFire EV1/EV2** (HF) | ISO 14443A | High | $3-$7 |
| **UHF Cards** | ISO 18000-6C | Medium | $2-$6 |

**Recommendation**: MIFARE cards (especially DESFire for security) offer the best balance of cost, security, and compatibility.

### Form Factors

1. **ISO Cards** (credit card sized)
   - Most common, can include printing for employee ID
   - Can include magnetic stripe or barcode
   - Comfortable in wallets

2. **Key Fobs**
   - Durable and convenient for keys
   - Smaller than cards
   - Higher cost than cards

3. **Wristbands**
   - Hands-free operation
   - Good for environments where cards might be damaged
   - Higher cost than cards

4. **Stickers/Labels**
   - Can be attached to existing ID cards
   - Lower cost
   - Less durable

**Recommendation**: ISO cards with employee photos and information are the most versatile choice.

## Network and Infrastructure Requirements

### Network Topology for RFID Readers

For a small to medium deployment (2-10 readers):

1. **Dedicated VLAN** for RFID readers
2. **Power over Ethernet (PoE)** for simpler installation
3. **Wired connections** preferred over Wi-Fi for reliability
4. **Central server** running your FastAPI application

### Power Requirements

1. **PoE (Power over Ethernet)**: Simplest option if readers support it
2. **DC Power Supplies**: Typically 12V DC
3. **Backup Power**: UPS for critical installations

### Cabling Recommendations

1. **Network**: Cat6 cable for all readers
2. **Power**: If not using PoE, use 18AWG 2-conductor cable
3. **Conduit**: Use where cables might be damaged

## Integration with Your Application

To integrate real RFID readers with your code:

1. **Use the built-in `RestAPIReader` class** for readers with REST API
2. **Create custom reader classes** that inherit from `RFIDReaderInterface` for other reader types
3. **Use a middleware approach** for readers without direct REST support:
   - Connect the reader to a small device like Raspberry Pi
   - Run a small web server on the Pi that exposes the REST API
   - Your main application connects to these Pi devices

### Integration Example for Readers without REST API

If you have readers with a different communication protocol, you can set up a middleware using Raspberry Pi:

```python
# On Raspberry Pi connected to RFID reader via USB/Serial
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import serial
import threading
import time

app = Flask(__name__)
last_rfid = None

def read_from_reader():
    global last_rfid
    # Configure for your specific reader
    ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600)
    while True:
        if ser.in_waiting > 0:
            rfid_data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
            if rfid_data:
                last_rfid = rfid_data
                # Clear the value after 2 seconds to simulate card removal
                threading.Timer(2.0, lambda: setattr(globals(), 'last_rfid', None)).start()
        time.sleep(0.1)

@app.route('/scan', methods=['GET'])
def scan():
    return jsonify({"rfid": last_rfid})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Start reader thread
    reader_thread = threading.Thread(target=read_from_reader, daemon=True)
    reader_thread.start()
    # Run the Flask app
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

## Testing and Deployment Tips

### Testing Procedure

1. **Start with a single reader** in a controlled environment
2. **Test with various card types** to ensure compatibility
3. **Simulate high-traffic periods** by rapidly scanning cards
4. **Monitor system logs** for errors or performance issues
5. **Test failover scenarios** (network outage, power loss)

### Deployment Checklist

1. **Physical installation** of readers at appropriate height and location
2. **Network configuration** (static IPs for readers)
3. **Reader configuration** (ensure proper scan mode and LED/beeper settings)
4. **Security hardening** (change default passwords, disable unused services)
5. **User training** on proper card usage

### Maintenance Plan

1. **Weekly test scans** to verify system operation
2. **Monthly log review** to identify potential issues
3. **Quarterly firmware updates** as released by manufacturers
4. **Annual hardware inspection** for damage or wear
